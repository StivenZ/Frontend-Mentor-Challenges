## My process

I just started by looking at the design and tried to follow a top-down approach.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The easiest way to structure and get a design done on the web is to sketch it first with HTML syntax. No CSS at all until I had a first full draft of the component. Sure there will be times where some CSS is necessary to actually see the shape of the component. Not this time.

### Continued development

This is the first challenge from Frontend Mentor, and it was pretty straightforward, I felt stuck at some point though, because I just couldn't center the whole thing in the screen (HTML body). Well, I actually could, but I just didn't want to make the main container absolute position and move things around with left 50% and top 50% and see if it actually looked fully centered... I wanted it to be pure flexbox and cool.

That's when I wrote these lines:

```
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

and everything went just fine.
